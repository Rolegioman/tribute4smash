                            Kirby (Japanese: カービィ, Hepburn: Kābī, Japanese pronunciation: [kaːbiː]) is the titular
                            protagonist of the Kirby series of video games owned by Nintendo and HAL Laboratory.
                            As one of Nintendo's most popular and familiar major mascots, Kirby's round appearance and
                            ability to copy his foes' powers has made him a well-known figure in video games,
                            consistently ranked as one of the most iconic video game characters. He first appeared in 1992
                            in Kirby's Dream Land for the Game Boy. Originally a placeholder, created by Masahiro Sakurai,
                            at the age of 19, for the game's early development, he has since then starred in over 20 games,
                            ranging from action platformers to puzzle, racing, and even pinball, and has been featured as a
                            playable fighter in all Super Smash Bros. games. He has also starred in his own anime and manga
                            series. Since 1999, he has been voiced by Makiko Ohmoto.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Kirby is known for being a small lightweight, being tied for the eighth-lightest character
                            in the game. True to his franchise, Kirby is a slow, yet floaty character. He has the 26th
                            slowest walking speed, 33rd fastest dashing speed, and 37th slowest initial dash. He also
                            has the 5th slowest air speed, 15th highest air acceleration, 3rd lowest gravity, the 5th
                            lowest falling and fast falling speeds, and above average traction. Due to these statistics,
                            Kirby has difficulty approaching opponents. Kirby's recovery is versatile: despite his slow
                            air speed and low jump height rendering him susceptible to edgeguarding, his five midair jumps,
                            slow falling speed, long vertical airdodge, and Final Cutter's decent distance give him good
                            stalling capabilities and decent safety.
